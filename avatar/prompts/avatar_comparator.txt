After executing the actions on user queries, some queries yielded good results, while others did not. Below are the positive and negative queries along with their corresponding evaluation metrics, which were computed using `node_score_dict` after executing the actions:

<pos_neg_queries>

Task:
1. Code Structure Analysis:
   - Examine modality decoupling implementation in Discovery class
   - Verify feature suppression mechanisms across different modalities
   - Review integration with causal_discovery module

2. Query Pattern Analysis:
   - Identify successful causal inference chains and their characteristics
   - Analyze failure cases related to modality decoupling or feature suppression
   - Evaluate if action selection considers query-specific modality features

3. Computational Logic Review:
   - Validate consistency between modality decoupling and causal score calculation
   - Check if node_score_dict properly integrates decoupled features
   - Verify causal path activation patterns in calculate_causal_score_by_llm

4. Implementation Recommendations:
   - Suggest improvements for modality-specific parameter handling
   - Propose optimizations for feature suppression thresholds
   - Recommend enhancements for causal score integration

Focus on high-level patterns relevant to the knowledge base schema. Do not use specific information like brand titles.
